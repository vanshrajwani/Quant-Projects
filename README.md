# Quant-Projects
This repository showcases a collection of projects that reflect my ongoing development in quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and data-driven research. Each project integrates mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and computational tools, built primarily using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and other relevant libraries.
ðŸ‘¤ About Me
I'm an undergraduate studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton, with a strong interest in quantitative trading and derivatives research. This project is part of my preparation for quant internships at trading firms, where I'm focused on applying mathematical modeling, market intuition, and software engineering to real-world problems like volatility surface construction and arbitrage detection.
