# Pairs Trading

This project implements and analyzes a **pairs trading strategy**, a classic example of statistical arbitrage in quantitative finance. The strategy identifies two historically correlated assets, monitors their price spread, and executes long/short positions when the spread deviates from its historical mean.

  2. Monitor their spread using z-scores.  
  3. Enter trades when the spread diverges beyond a threshold.  
  4. Close trades when the spread reverts to the mean.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels.
